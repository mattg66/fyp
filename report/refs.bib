  abstract  = {Network administration activities pose scalability challenges. Challenges arise when the devices handled are very numerous. Instead of using traditional methods, IT organizations need to implement automation methods. It is very inefficient to administer a large number of network devices by logging into them one by one. Human error is very susceptible to occur, which will cause configuration inconsistencies, to configuration errors, which will have an impact on poor network services provided. The automation method on the network is known as Network Automation (NA). NA uses an algorithmic approach in arranging steps in problem solving. NA is executed in the form of an application program that has the main function of automating routine, complex, repetitive, and comprehensive activities. Network administration activities that can be automated include routing automation, virtual administration and backup or restore. The simulation of NA implemented by ANA. ANA is the test is which was carried out using the Python programming language by utilizing Paramiko and Netmiko Library in a virtual environment using GNS3 and Virtual Box. The purpose of developing ANA was to make network administration activities run more efficiently. The results of applying the ANA can be taken into consideration in network administration activities. The result showed ANA was effective to prove the NA purpose.}

ABSTRACT = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is an innovative architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane to simplify and speed up the management of large networks. This means the control logic has been moved from the network hardware level to the centralized control management level. Therefore, the use of the OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) is one of the most common protocols used to discover the network topology in a data plane and then transmit it to the control plane for management. However, OFDP has various shortcomings in its performance such as exchanging too many messages between both levels (control and data), which in turn increases the load on the SDN-Controller. Additionally, since the application layer depends entirely on the network topologies plotted in the control plane, it is very important to obtain accurate network topology information from data plane. Therefore, after providing background on topology discovery protocols to the reader, we will concentrate on performance issues. The present study identifies and discuss the primary concerns involved in the complex query process, infrastructure, influencing factors, and challenges for the topology discovery process. Furthermore, this paper will present several recent studies that have overcome and enhanced these issues. In addition, open discussion and future work concerning these issues are also discussed.},

abstract = {Software Defined Network implementation has seen tremendous growth and deployment in different types of networks. Compared to traditional networks it decouples the control logic from network layer devices and centralizes it for efficient traffic forwarding and flow management across the domain. This multi-layered architecture has data forwarding devices at the bottom in the data plane, which is programmed by controllers in the control plane. The high-level management plane interacts with the control plane to program the whole network and enforce different policies. The interaction among these planes is done through interfaces that work as communication/programming protocols. In this survey, we present a comprehensive study of these interface and programming protocols, which are primarily classified into southbound, northbound, and east/westbound interfaces. This work first classifies each of them into subcategories and then presents a comprehensive comparative analysis. As the different interfaces have different properties, hence, the sub-classification and their analysis are done using different properties. In addition, we also discuss the impact of different virtualization techniques, such as hypervisors, on interface protocols and inter-plane communication. More over specialized interfaces for emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks are also presented. Finally, the paper highlights several short term and long term research challenges and open issues specific to the SDN interface protocols.}
