  journal   = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
  abstract  = {Network administration activities pose scalability challenges. Challenges arise when the devices handled are very numerous. Instead of using traditional methods, IT organizations need to implement automation methods. It is very inefficient to administer a large number of network devices by logging into them one by one. Human error is very susceptible to occur, which will cause configuration inconsistencies, to configuration errors, which will have an impact on poor network services provided. The automation method on the network is known as Network Automation (NA). NA uses an algorithmic approach in arranging steps in problem solving. NA is executed in the form of an application program that has the main function of automating routine, complex, repetitive, and comprehensive activities. Network administration activities that can be automated include routing automation, virtual administration and backup or restore. The simulation of NA implemented by ANA. ANA is the test is which was carried out using the Python programming language by utilizing Paramiko and Netmiko Library in a virtual environment using GNS3 and Virtual Box. The purpose of developing ANA was to make network administration activities run more efficiently. The results of applying the ANA can be taken into consideration in network administration activities. The result showed ANA was effective to prove the NA purpose.}
