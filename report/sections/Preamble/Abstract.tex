\section*{Abstract}
This project will aim to provide an automation platform to CX Labs UK within Cisco Systems that will streamline DMZ lab operations by providing a web interface that will allow infrastructure to be managed from the perspective of the available rack space. Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure shall be used to provide network connectivity and VMware ESXi and vCenter shall be used to provide compute resources. A testbed will be constructed to emulate a scaled-down version of lab infrastructure that will be used to develop and test the automation platform against Cisco ACI and vCenter. The platform will aim to obfuscate as much network configuration as possible, resulting in a drastic reduction in time spent provisioning lab rack space when a project enters or terminates. This will result in a streamlined network configuration that represents the current state of usage, as the configuration will be managed entirely by the automation platform and derived from the user's inputs into the web interface.
