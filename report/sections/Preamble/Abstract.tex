\section*{Abstract}
The purpose of this project is to provide a solution to CX Labs UK within
  Cisco Systems LTD that will streamline the operation of DMZ lab-space. The
  application shall allow lab staff to prepare network infrastructure for an
  incoming project with little to no CLI interaction and it shall be web based.
  ACI, VMware ESXi and vCenter shall be used to manage the networking and virtual
  machines respectively. The lab-space will be represented by a small testbed
  containing the minimum quantity of networking equipment and compute resources
  required to accurately simulate the environment.
