\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
The overall goal of this automation platform was to reduce the amount of human interaction required when a new project enters a testing environment. A user can now attach the solution to an \gls{aci} fabric and vCenter environment with the required prerequisites, and deploy projects to rackspace with no involvement. Whilst this has been met, manual intervention from the user is still required as no remote access \gls{vpn} is provisioned automatically.
The user interface was designed in a simple manner that shouldn't require extensive training to utilise, and only basic familiarisation with how the solution works would be required.


\subsection{Future Expansion}
\label{sec:future-expansion}
The solution has been built in a modular fashion, so in the future,  any potential expansion will be easy to achieve. Features that were left out due to time restrictions such as a login system and continuous monitoring would be useful to implement in the future.
