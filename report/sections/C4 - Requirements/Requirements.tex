\chapter{Requirements}
\label{chap:requirements}
This chapter will provide in more detail the requirements of the automation
platform. The requirements will be split into 2 sections, namely the functional
requirements and the non-functional requirements. The functional requirements
will outline the features that the platform must have, and the non-functional
requirements will outline the requirements that the platform must meet in order
to be successful.
In order to prioritise the requirements, the MoSCoW method will be used. This
method will allow for the requirements to be prioritised and will ensure that
the most important requirements are met first. The MoSCoW method is a
prioritisation method that splits requirements into 4 categories, namely Must
Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won’t Have.
